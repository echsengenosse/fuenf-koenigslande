# Bezaubert (Charmed)
Charmed usually benefits the one who cast the spell, as a charmed target can't attack or target the charmer in any way. Plus, the charmer has advantage on social ability checks with the creature. This condition will usually last until the spell runs out, however it can be removed with the fifth level Greater Restoration spell.

# Blind (Blinded)
As the name suggests, a blinded creature is unable to see, meaning they cannot pass any ability check that requires sight. On top of that, the blinded creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and anything attacking the blinded creature has advantage. While blindness can be caused by some spells, a more common example is when a species without darkvision enters a pitch-black area without light, which is why it's important to always being a torch along.

# Erschöpfung (Exhaustion)
Exhaustion is slightly more complicated than other conditions, as it has levels of severity. There are six levels of exhaustion, with points being gained through abilities and environmental hazards. For example, going too long without eating and being out in cold weather without proper clothing will gain the creature a point of exhaustion.

Level one gives disadvantage to ability checks. Two halves the creatures speed. Three gives disadvantage to attack rolls and saving throws. Four halves the creatures maximum hit points. Five reduces speed to zero. Finally, the sixth and final level causes death. Levels are reduced as the player counters the hazard, such as eating when starved or warming up by a fire after being out in the cold.

# Taub (Deafened)
A creature who is deafened cannot hear any sound and will immediately fail any ability checks that require hearing. Usually, this condition will have a set duration from whatever spell or object caused it, or the creature will have to pass a Constitution saving throw to remove the effect.

# Verängstigt (Frightened)
Being inflicted by the frightened condition means the creature is terrified by whatever caused it. Frightened gives the creature disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the cause of fear is in their line of sight. Also, the creature cannot move closer to the source of its fear by choice. Depending on the specifics of the spell causing it, a frightened creature will usually have to succeed a constitution saving throw at the end of their turn to remove the effect.
